An extraordinary level of commitment, proactivity, self-discipline and the ability to work well under pressure are expected of candidates.\nFor admission to the programme, a professional academic degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) is required in the areas of computer science, mathematics, natural sciences or engineering. The application should demonstrate sufficient knowledge of concepts, methods and tools in the field of computer science. Such knowledge is usually acquired in a four-year computer science course with at least 65% computer science content. Applicants who have already graduated from a first-level degree course of study in mathematical/scientific subjects or engineering can be admitted to the programme provided that the first-level degree course of study had a computer science content of, as a rule, at least 50%. They may also have to perform additional assignments, to be specified on an individual basis, worth up to 12 ECTS credits. Admission is based solely on credentials and academic excellence.\nFor your application to be reviewed by our admissions committee, a grade point average (GPA) of 2.5 or better on the German grading scale (1=excellent to 5=fail) is necessary. Grades from other countries are converted to the German equivalent by applying the \"Bavarian formula\". You can check if your GPA meets this criterion by performing the conversion yourself:\nNMax is maximum possible grade of your university's grading system.\n\n\nNMin is lowest passing grade of your university's grading system.\n\n\nNd is your GPA which needs to be mapped to the German grading scale.\nYour German-equivalent GPA = 1 + (3*[(Nmax-Nd)/(NMax - NMin)]).\nFor example, if NMax = 100, NMin = 60 and Nd = 78.2, then the equivalent score on the German scale is equal to 1 + (3 X [(100 - 78.2)/(100 - 60)]) which evaluates to 2.635. As the GPA in this example is greater than 2.5, it would not meet the given criterion.\nLanguage Requirements: The TOEFL, IELTS, or Cambridge Certificate for English language proficiency is required for all candidates who meet any of the following criteria:\n• Candidates who do not have English as the de facto language in their country (i.e. countries other than Australia, Bahamas, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and USA)\nCandidates who do not have English as the de facto language in their country (i.e. countries other than Australia, Bahamas, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and USA)\n• Citizens of Australia, Bahamas, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and USA whose first language is not English (i.e. those who have lived in countries other than those mentioned here and who have not obtained a school diploma that conforms to one of the national certificates of these countries – e.g. high school diploma, IB diploma, A-levels, and so on).\nCitizens of Australia, Bahamas, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and USA whose first language is not English (i.e. those who have lived in countries other than those mentioned here and who have not obtained a school diploma that conforms to one of the national certificates of these countries – e.g. high school diploma, IB diploma, A-levels, and so on).\nExemptions are granted to applicants who meet any of the following criteria:\n• Candidates who have earned a Bachelor's degree from universities in Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and US\nCandidates who have earned a Bachelor's degree from universities in Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and US\n• Candidates who have earned degrees from English-language degree programmes in Germany/EU\nCandidates who have earned degrees from English-language degree programmes in Germany/EU\nThe\nminimum required language skill level\nis\nupper B2\naccording to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

Applicants are selected by an inter-departmental admissions committee.\nProspective students must have completed a\nfirst academic degree\n(Bachelor’s or equivalent) with a standard period of study of at least six semesters (three years). This first degree must be in a field which is thematically relevant to this Master’s programme: literature, linguistics, cultural studies, book studies, media studies, communication studies, history, political science, sociology, social anthropology, ethnology, philosophy, theology, educational science, art history or psychology.\nApplicants must prove a\nspecial qualification and suitability\nfor this programme, which is assessed through the grades attained in MA-relevant focal subjects during their BA studies (or equivalent) as certified by their BA diploma (or equivalent) and transcript of student records, through the CV, evidence of previous international and professional experience (where applicable), and a\nshort essay task\n: Applicants will be asked to submit an essay of approximately 2,000 words that meets accepted standards of academic writing with regard to both form and referencing.\nEssays containing plagiarism will be disqualified.

We expect our students to have a solid background in basic engineering subjects, as well as good foundations in information technology and communications. Our students should be proficient in the following:\n• mathematics and statistics\nmathematics and statistics\n• physics\nphysics\n• foundations of communication technology\nfoundations of communication technology\n• foundations of communication systems\nfoundations of communication systems\n• signal theory\nsignal theory\n• software engineering\nsoftware engineering\n• computer architecture\ncomputer architecture\n• electronics and semiconductor devices\nelectronics and semiconductor devices\nA Bachelor's degree (or equivalent) in a related area is mandatory, and the transcripts of the Bachelor's degree must confirm the candidates' solid background in the field of information and communication engineering. Degree programmes in electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science and communications engineering are known to provide such background, but a Bachelor's degree in one of these majors does not guarantee acceptance to the programme.

All degree certificates and transcripts are carefully analysed by a committee in order to ascertain whether the candidate has the right background for the programme.\nLanguage Requirements: All our candidates are expected to be proficient in the English language. An English proficiency certificate should accompany the application material. We accept the following certificates: TOEFL 570 (paper-based), TOEFL 230 (computer-based), IELTS 6.5, Cambridge CPE level C. In the event that the applicant has a certificate of an English-speaking Bachelor's degree, he/she does not need an additional language test.\nApplication Deadline: The application process starts on 1 March.

Degrees in engineering without clear cognitive focus or in pedagogy are normally not sufficient qualifications.\nYour previous studies should already demonstrate your interest in cognitive sciences and embodied cognition. This should also be highlighted in your motivation letter, in which you can also list other relevant qualifications you may have (such as research internships, programming skills, or knowledge of specific literature). You should specifically describe whether you have already completed an experimental internship course and also state your knowledge of calculus and linear algebra because these qualifications are relevant for your admission.\nYou can read more about the subject-specific admission requirements in the respective\nadmission regulations\n.\nLanguage Requirements: English language proficiency requirements correspond to the B2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.\nApplication Deadline: For current application deadlines, please refer to:\nwww.uni-potsdam.de/en/studium/application-enrollment/application-master\n.\nSubmit Application: Please submit your application via\nuni-assist\n.",
